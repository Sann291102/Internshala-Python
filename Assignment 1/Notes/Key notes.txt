Data can be words numbers sentences
Data type is a classification of data  
Numerics

1.Numeric Literal:

->It refers to a fixed value in the source code.

->Eg:X = 10(Where 10 is Literal value)
->Because the value X is fixed the -value is assigned in-built.

->Python identifies 3 type they are 
(Interger, float, complex).

2.Other integers types:

->(Binary, octal , hexadecimals)

->Eg: 
Binary = (0110, 0011)
Octal = (0012, 0o30,0o64)
Hexadecimal = (0x12, 0x21).

3.Arthemetic operators.

3.String Data Types.

->Character it self have the Index starting with Zero.

-> Formats specifics.

(
%c = Character, 
%s = string conversion via str() prior to formatting.
%i = signed decimal integer.
%d = signed decimal integer.
%u = unsigned decimal integer.
%o = Octal interger.
%x = hexadecimal integer.)

4.Methods for string processing.
there are many methods in string processing they are as follows.
(capitalize(), upper(), lower(), title(), find(), index(), count(), isalpha(), is digit(), islower(), issupper(),)

5. List and Tuple.

-> Both the list and tuple are ordered Collection of data types in python.

-> List : List is mutable we can store various types of data in list.
we note it with [] brackets.
bucketlist=[].

->Tuple : Tuple is unmuttale. we can store all types of data in tuple.
We note it with()Brackets.
buckettuple = ().

6. Set:

->Set is also a collection of data types but however it is not an ordered collection of data objects.

-> In set operations indexing and slicing is not possible.

-> Set deosnot allow duplicate objects to be stored like list and tuple.

-> Set is defined to mathematics.

-> Set object has suitable methods to perform mathematic Problems.

-> The set operations are as follows they are : 

-> Set() function has a inbuilt function set() using which set objects can construct out of any sequence like string , list or tuple object.

->In set we can either modify like we do it in list with the methods using like :(add(), update(), clear, copy() , discard(), remove() ).

-> To define set we use "Double Quotes".

-> We can perform set operation with various function like (union(), intersection(), difference() , symmetricdifference().).

-> We know that python contains some built in functions to identify lists or tuple they are (len(), mac(), min(), ).
-> wit the len() function we will know how many items we have in the particular list.

->with max() it is used to identify the max number in any list or tuple that existed.

-> We can manipulate the list using functions like (append(), insert(), remove(), pop(), reverse(), sort(), ).

-> To convert one sequence type to another sequence type. They are (list(), tuple(). )

7. Dictionary data type.

-> Dictionary is not an ordered like list or tuple but in dictionary you can use list or tuple.

-> Built in fucntions for dictionaries in python are as follows (del , pop(), clear(),) 
(len(), max(), min() can also be used in Dict).

-> To delete any items in dictionary we use (del()) function. its parenthesis.

-> Same thing happens with the pop() function in python dict. We can use use clear() to delete.
